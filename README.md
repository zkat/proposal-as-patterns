## Introduction

When matching non-Identifier values, it's often the case that users might want
to also bind that value to an Identifier while doing the matching. For this
reason, it's proposed that destructuring be extended with the ability to do
this sort of binding. `match` will benefit from this change by allowing matching
operations against values that are also put into identifiers, since identifiers
are irrefutable patterns.

The syntax uses an `as` keyword, and looks as follows:

```js
match (x) {
  {x: {y: 1} as x} => x.y === 1
}
```

Note: This syntax is [used by
F#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/pattern-matching).
It's also reminiscent of `as` syntax in `import` statements, so there's some
precedent in the language for this sort of binding (`import * as bar from
'./x.js'`)
